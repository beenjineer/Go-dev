## How Go works 
go mod init: initializes and writes a new go.mod file in the current directory
go mod tidy: ensures that the go.mod file matches the source code in the module. It adds any missing module requirements necessary to build the current moduleâ€™s packages and dependencies, and it removes requirements on modules that donâ€™t provide any relevant packages. It also adds any missing entries to go.sum and removes unnecessary entries.

modules -> lib dependencies, go.mod enables tracking of such dependencies in your module 
module authentication: making sure downloaded direct and indirect dependencies are correct, go.sum checks the cryptographic hask, checksum -> data integrity
